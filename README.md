# Facebook Ads Campaign Analysis 

## 📌 Overview  
This project showcases a **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze Facebook advertising campaigns. The goal was to transform raw ad data into **actionable insights** using DAX measures and clear visual storytelling.

- **Conversion Rate** = Conversions ÷ Clicks → Effectiveness of clicks in driving results  
- **CPC (Cost per Click)** = Spend ÷ Clicks → Average cost of traffic  
- **CPA (Cost per Acquisition)** = Spend ÷ Conversions → ROI metric for each conversion  
- **Total vs Approved Conversions** → Distinguishes reach vs quality of leads  
- **Spend, Impressions, Clicks** → Core campaign scale indicators
